PREPARATION:
- Clone from Git
- Install Node.js
- NPM install


ASK THE AUDIENCE:
- Do you write unit test in JavaScript?
- Experience in unit testing on other languages?
- Which framework: Jasmine, Mocha, Jest?
- Jasmine is just a tool, the lessons will apply to others too. Syntax is similar
   
- Ask questions anytime. Assistants are here to help


WHY WE TEST:
- Avoid regressions
- Consume your own API
- Ruthlessy refactor
- Avoid "don't touch the legacy mess" situations
- Narrow the mental focus by giving devs a "safety net"
- Reduce the cost of context switch


BBD:
- Cucumber, anyone?
- BDD and all that jazz

- Describe test as you are talking to the guy sitting next to you
  You talk to humans, not computers
  A good story is more tha just a test, it documents and last in memory

- An hole in the story means an hole in the test
  An hole in JUnit is hard to spot instead

- Narrative tests. The importance of story telling
- Tests are code samples too
- Useful "live" documentation


EXAMPLES:
- luga.string.format()


WIZARD AS EXAMPLE:

- Testing the GUI, not only the logic. How far we can/should go?
- Quick Wizard's demo
- Explain Wizard/Step relationship
- Testing menus and buttons
- Testing DOM elements and CSS classes
- Testing events (onclick etc)
- Jasmine vs Selenium

- Limitations with keyboad and focus/blur


EXERCISES:
- String manipulation TDD
  $first.second.thrird[1] -> first second third 1


ADVANCED:
- SetUp/TearDown beforeEach/afterEach
- Spies
  With spies you test the single unit
  Controller.Spec.js Spies and Mocks
  Mayn bugs hide at the boundaries

- Do we need mock libraries?

- Use xdescribe


FIXTURES:
- luga.form.toQueryString()
- loadFixture() vs readFixture()
- jasmineFixtures vs jasmine-jquery
- Limitation of fixtures vs live output from server


CODE COVERAGE:
- Infrastructure: Karma, Instanbul
- It's just a number, required but not sufficient
- Try to reach 100% may be a worth learning exercise


THE ECOSYSTEM:
- A list of useful links
- Plain HTML runner vs Karma
- Karma
- JUnit xml reports for CI
- Additional matchers
- jasmine-ajax
- Browserstack and multiple browsers


FINAL REMARKS:
- Quick round of feedback
- Code is on Github, for what's worth
- Luga JS is worth looking for examples

- A place to talk for Frontenders Ticino?
