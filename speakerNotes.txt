- Ask audience:
  frameworks vs no.
  Which framework: Angular, React, Vue, Cycle?
  jQuery: yes/no?

TITLE:
- There must be a way in between
  I want to reflect a bit on the implications of using frameworks, maybe spark a debate
- I just wanted to fetch some data from a JSON file

THE STORY:
- I need to do something simple, a poor man SPA and fetch some data from JSON
- I asked my friends Lorenzo and Luca. And they suggested a huge toolstack!!!
  Show the suggestions
  Men, I just need to do something simple, display the data and call it done!

WHAT I NEEDED:
- Simple databinding/templating
- Ability to read data from JSON and RSS
- Routing
- Glue code to bring all together
- Proper unit tests

WHAT I DID, WITH WHAT:
- Handlebars/Luga Data
- Luga Router
- Some jQuery as library, plus dead-simple UI
- A bit of Boostrap out of laziness
- Jasmine for testing, 100% code coverage. Had to use Gulp/Karma for coverage

WHAT I DID NOT:
- Concatenate/minify (dead simple with Gulp or similar)
- The UI would not scale

LOOK AT INTERESTING LIBRARIES:
- Read the list, ask the audience and expand the discussion
- Check who knows and use which library
- Implications of using library. Less dependency, more ad-hoc, more bus-factor

FRAMEWORK CRAZINESS:
- This is not the first time
- We had this in the past: 
  Dojo, YUI, Closure, Prototype/Scriptaculous, Mochikit!
  The MVC: Ember, Backbone, Knockout, Angular
  The reactive: React, Vue, Cycle
- Is transpiling the way to go? Who use it?

FINAL REMARKS:
- Code is on Github, for what's worth
- It's not the code, is the question
- IT world is driven by fashion. Be careful
